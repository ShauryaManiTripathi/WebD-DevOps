Okay, here are the detailed, book-like notes from the second transcript, aiming to capture every nuance and detail:
In JavaScript, `var` and `let` are both used to declare variables, but they differ in scope, hoisting behavior, and redeclaration rules.

**Scope:**

- **`var`**: Function-scoped. Accessible throughout the function it's declared in.

  
```javascript
  function example() {
    if (true) {
      var x = 10;
    }
    console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
  }
  example();
  ```


- **`let`**: Block-scoped. Accessible only within the block `{}` it's declared in.

  
```javascript
  function example() {
    if (true) {
      let y = 20;
    }
    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
  }
  example();
  ```


**Hoisting:**

- **`var`**: Declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.

  
```javascript
  console.log(a); // Outputs: undefined
  var a = 5;
  ```


- **`let`**: Declarations are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing before declaration results in a ReferenceError.

  
```javascript
  console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
  let b = 10;
  ```


**Redeclaration:**

- **`var`**: Allows redeclaration within the same scope.

  
```javascript
  var c = 1;
  var c = 2;
  console.log(c); // Outputs: 2
  ```


- **`let`**: Does not allow redeclaration within the same scope.

  
```javascript
  let d = 3;
  let d = 4; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'd' has already been declared
  ```


Understanding these differences is crucial for effective variable management in JavaScript. 

**Chapter 3: Diving Deeper into JavaScript - Types, Threads, and Functions**

**3.1 Strict vs. Dynamically Typed Languages**

*   **Introduction:** The discussion shifts to the nature of JavaScript as a programming language, contrasting it with languages like C++. A key distinction is *typing*.
*   **Strict Typing (C++ Example):**
    *   Example Code (Conceptual C++):
        ```c++
        int number = 5; // Declare 'number' as an integer and assign 5
        number = "hello"; // Attempt to assign a string to an integer variable
        ```
    *   **Compile-Time Error:** In C++, this code will generate a *compile-time error*. The C++ compiler, during the compilation phase (before the program runs), detects the type mismatch. It flags that you are trying to assign a string value to a variable declared as an integer.
    *   **Type Safety:**  Strict typing enforces type safety. Once a variable is declared with a specific type (like `int`), it's expected to hold only values of that type throughout its lifetime.
    *   **Advantages of Strict Typing:**
        *   **Early Error Detection:** Catches type-related errors during compilation, preventing runtime surprises.
        *   **Code Maintainability:** Makes code more predictable and easier to understand in large projects because types are clearly defined.
*   **Dynamically Typed/Loosely Typed (JavaScript):**
    *   **Example Code (Conceptual JavaScript):**
        ```javascript
        let number = 5; // Declare 'number' and assign 5 (type is inferred as number)
        number = "hello"; // Reassign 'number' to a string value
        ```
    *   **Runtime Execution:** JavaScript will *run* this code without any initial error.  JavaScript is interpreted at *runtime*, not compiled ahead of time in the same way as C++.
    *   **Type Flexibility:** JavaScript allows variables to change their data types during the program's execution. The variable `number` starts as a number and is later reassigned to hold a string.
    *   **Advantages of Dynamic Typing (Initial Impression, often debated):**
        *   **Rapid Prototyping:** Can write code quickly without being bogged down by type declarations.
        *   **Flexibility:** Can be seen as more flexible for certain tasks, especially in scripting scenarios.
    *   **Disadvantages of Dynamic Typing (Especially in large projects):**
        *   **Runtime Errors:** Type-related errors may only surface when the program is running, potentially in production, making them harder to debug.
        *   **Reduced Code Clarity (in large projects):** In large codebases, the lack of static types can make it harder to track variable types and understand data flow, increasing the risk of errors and making maintenance more challenging.
*   **TypeScript as a Solution:**
    *   **Addressing JavaScript's Weakness:**  TypeScript was created to address the type-related limitations of JavaScript, especially for large and complex applications.
    *   **Static Typing for JavaScript:** TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript. It allows you to define types explicitly, similar to C++, bringing the benefits of compile-time type checking to JavaScript development.
    *   **Optimization:** TypeScript can be seen as an optimization layer *on top of* JavaScript. It enhances JavaScript with static typing but ultimately compiles down to standard JavaScript, which can then run in browsers or Node.js environments.
*   **JavaScript's Dynamic Nature - Historical Context:** Raw JavaScript was originally designed to be dynamically typed to be user-friendly and flexible for web scripting, enabling quick development in the browser environment.

**3.2 Single-Threaded Nature of JavaScript**

*   **Single-Threaded vs. Multi-Threaded Languages:**  A fundamental distinction in programming language paradigms related to how they handle concurrency (running multiple tasks seemingly at the same time).
*   **Multi-Threaded Languages (Java, C++, Rust, Go):**
    *   **Cores and Parallelism:** Multi-threaded languages can leverage multiple CPU cores in a machine to execute different parts of a program *truly in parallel*.
    *   **Thread Concept:**  These languages allow developers to create and manage *threads*. A thread is a unit of execution that can run concurrently with other threads within the same program.
    *   **Increased Performance (for suitable tasks):** By distributing workload across multiple cores using threads, multi-threaded programs can potentially achieve significant performance improvements for tasks that can be parallelized (broken down into independent sub-tasks).
*   **Single-Threaded Languages (JavaScript - Historically):**
    *   **Single Core at a Time:** JavaScript, by its nature, is *single-threaded*. This means that a JavaScript program, in its standard execution model, runs on a *single CPU core* at any given moment.
    *   **Sequential Execution:** Code in a JavaScript program is executed *line by line*, in a sequential order within a single thread.
    *   **No True Parallelism (Standard JavaScript):** Standard JavaScript *cannot* directly split its execution across multiple CPU cores to achieve true parallelism in the way multi-threaded languages can.
    *   **Context Switching (Operating System Level):** While JavaScript itself is single-threaded, the *operating system* can perform *context switching*. This means the OS can rapidly switch between different processes (like your browser, Zoom, code editor, etc.) and even between threads within a single process. This *illusion* of concurrency is managed by the OS, not by JavaScript directly at a language level for code execution within a single JavaScript runtime environment.
    *   **Example Scenario - Multiple Node.js Processes:** If you run *two* separate Node.js processes on a multi-core machine, they *can* run on different cores. However, *within* each individual Node.js process, the JavaScript code is still single-threaded.
*   **Implications of Single-Threadedness for Scalability (Historically):**
    *   **Limited Core Utilization (Traditionally):**  In the past, the single-threaded nature was sometimes seen as a limitation for highly scalable server-side applications. On powerful multi-core servers (e.g., rented on AWS), a single Node.js process might only utilize one core, leaving the other cores underutilized. This could be seen as inefficient for CPU-bound tasks in server environments.
    *   **Contrast with Java:** Java, being multi-threaded, could potentially utilize all cores on a server, making it seem more suitable for very high-load, scalable server applications (in certain scenarios).
    *   **Modern JavaScript and Workarounds (Cluster Module, Asynchronous Programming - later topics):**  While JavaScript is fundamentally single-threaded in its core execution, there are mechanisms to mitigate the limitations:
        *   **Node.js Cluster Module:** Node.js provides a `cluster` module that allows you to create *multiple Node.js processes* that can run concurrently and distribute load across multiple cores. This is a way to achieve *process-level parallelism* even though JavaScript within each process remains single-threaded.
        *   **Asynchronous Programming (Event Loop - coming soon):**  JavaScript's strength is its *asynchronous, non-blocking* nature, which is crucial for handling I/O-bound operations (like network requests, file system access) efficiently in a single-threaded environment. This allows JavaScript to handle many concurrent operations *without* relying on multiple threads for code execution within a single thread of control.
*   **Practical Consequence - Line-by-Line Execution:**  In practice, for most JavaScript code you write:
    *   Execution happens sequentially, line by line.
    *   You generally don't need to worry about low-level thread management (unlike in multi-threaded languages).
    *   The focus shifts to efficient asynchronous programming to handle concurrency within the single-threaded model, which is where concepts like the event loop become critical.
*   **Bounty Challenge Context:** The bounty challenge related to CPU usage was designed to illustrate this single-threaded nature and observe CPU core utilization when running a CPU-intensive JavaScript loop. The unexpected result (Htop not showing 100% initially) turned out to be a tooling issue with Htop, rather than a fundamental flaw in the understanding of JavaScript's threading model (as revealed by the `top` command).

**3.3 Basic JavaScript Syntax: Variables, Data Types, and Operators**

*   **Recap and Poll:**  A quick poll is conducted to gauge the audience's familiarity with basic programming concepts (variables, arrays, loops, if/else).  A significant portion (75%) indicates prior knowledge, while 25% are newer to these concepts. The pace will be adjusted to accommodate both groups.
*   **Variables:**
    *   **Definition:**  Variables are named storage locations in memory used to hold data values.  The value of a variable can *vary* (change) during program execution.
    *   **Declaration Keywords:** JavaScript provides three keywords for declaring variables:
        *   **`var` (Historical):** The original keyword for variable declaration.  It has some scoping behaviors that are now considered less desirable and can lead to confusion in larger projects.  Generally *avoid `var` in modern JavaScript*.
        *   **`let` (Modern):**  Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).  `let` declares variables with *block scope*. This is generally preferred for variables whose values *might change* during the program.
        *   **`const` (Modern):** Introduced in ES6. `const` declares variables that are *constants*.  Once a `const` variable is assigned a value, *its value cannot be reassigned*. `const` variables also have *block scope*.  Use `const` whenever you know a variable's value should not change.
    *   **Example (`let` and `const`):**
        ```javascript
        let a = 1; // Declare 'a' using 'let' and initialize to 1
        console.log(a); // Output: 1

        a = 2;     // Reassign 'a' to 2 (allowed with 'let')
        console.log(a); // Output: 2

        const b = 1; // Declare 'b' using 'const' and initialize to 1
        console.log(b); // Output: 1

        // b = 2;     // This would cause an error! Reassignment not allowed for 'const'
        // console.log(b);
        ```
    *   **`console.log()`:** A built-in JavaScript function used to print output to the console (typically the browser's developer console or the terminal if running Node.js). It's essential for debugging and displaying information.
*   **Data Types (Primitives):**
    *   **Strings:**  Represent text. Enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).
        ```javascript
        let name = "herkirak"; // String literal
        let message = 'Hello world'; // Another string literal
        ```
    *   **Numbers:** Represent numeric values (integers, floating-point numbers).
        ```javascript
        let age = 18;      // Integer
        let price = 99.99; // Floating-point number
        ```
    *   **Booleans:** Represent truth values: `true` or `false`.
        ```javascript
        let isMarried = false; // Boolean false
        let isLoggedIn = true;  // Boolean true
        ```
    *   **Example - Combining Strings and Variables in `console.log()` (String Interpolation):**
        ```javascript
        let firstName = "Herkirath";
        let age = 18;
        let isMarried = false;

        console.log("This person's name is " + firstName + " and their age is " + age); // String concatenation (older style)

        console.log(`This person's name is ${firstName} and their age is ${age}.`); // Template literals (ES6 - preferred, more readable).  Backticks (`) are used.  Variables are embedded using `${variableName}`.
        ```
        *   **Template Literals (Backticks `):**  A more modern and readable way to create strings that include variables. Use backticks (\`) to enclose the string, and `${variableName}` to embed variable values directly within the string.

**3.4 Control Flow: `if/else` Statements**

*   **Purpose:** `if/else` statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They are fundamental for decision-making in programs.
*   **Syntax:**
    ```javascript
    if (condition) {
        // Code to execute if 'condition' is true
    } else {
        // Code to execute if 'condition' is false (optional 'else' block)
    }
    ```
    *   **`condition`:** An expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. This is often a comparison (e.g., `age > 18`, `isMarried === true`).
    *   **`if` block:** The code inside the curly braces `{}` following the `if` keyword is executed *only if* the `condition` is `true`.
    *   **`else` block (optional):** The code inside the `else` block is executed *only if* the `condition` in the `if` statement is `false`.  The `else` block is not required; you can have just an `if` statement.
*   **Example - Marital Status Program:**
    ```javascript
    let firstName = "Herkirath";
    let isMarried = false;

    if (isMarried === true) { // Condition: Check if 'isMarried' is true
        console.log(`${firstName} is married.`);
    } else {                 // 'else' block executes if 'isMarried' is false
        console.log(`${firstName} is not married.`);
    }

    // Changing 'isMarried' to 'true' would change the output.
    isMarried = true;
    if (isMarried === true) {
        console.log(`${firstName} is married.`); // This block would now execute
    } else {
        console.log(`${firstName} is not married.`);
    }
    ```
    *   **`===` (Strict Equality Operator):** In the example, `isMarried === true` is used for comparison.  `===` checks for both value and type equality. It's generally recommended to use `===` and `!==` in JavaScript for equality checks to avoid potential type coercion issues.
    *   **Alternative Condition - `if (isMarried)`:**  In JavaScript, you can often simplify conditions if you are checking for truthiness or falsiness. Since `isMarried` is a boolean, `if (isMarried)` is often sufficient and is equivalent to `if (isMarried === true)`. Similarly, `if (!isMarried)` is equivalent to `if (isMarried === false)`.

**3.5 Control Flow: Loops - `for` Loop**

*   **Purpose:** Loops are used to *repeat* a block of code multiple times. They are essential for tasks that involve iterating over data, performing actions repeatedly, or counting.
*   **`for` Loop Syntax (Common `for` loop):**
    ```javascript
    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
        // Code to be repeated (loop body)
    }
    ```
    *   **`initialization`:** Executed *once* at the beginning of the loop. Typically used to declare and initialize a loop counter variable (e.g., `let i = 0`).
    *   **`condition`:** Evaluated *before each iteration*. As long as the `condition` is `true`, the loop body will execute. When the `condition` becomes `false`, the loop terminates. (e.g., `i <= 100`, `i < array.length`).
    *   **`increment/decrement`:** Executed *after each iteration* of the loop body. Typically used to update the loop counter (e.g., `i++` to increment `i` by 1, `i--` to decrement, `i = i + 2` to increment by 2).
    *   **Loop Body (`{ ... }`):** The block of code enclosed in curly braces that will be executed repeatedly as long as the `condition` is `true`.
*   **Example - Counting and Summing Numbers (0 to 100):**
    ```javascript
    let answer = 0; // Initialize a variable to store the sum

    for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) { // Initialize i=0, loop while i <= 100, increment i after each iteration
        answer = answer + i;        // Add the current value of 'i' to 'answer' in each iteration
    }

    console.log(answer); // Output: 5050 (sum of numbers from 0 to 100)
    ```
    *   **Loop Variable `i`:** The variable `i` is commonly used as the loop counter in `for` loops. It's a convention, but you can use any valid variable name.
    *   **`i++` (Increment Operator):**  `i++` is a shorthand for `i = i + 1`. It increments the value of `i` by 1.
    *   **Loop Execution Flow:**
        1.  `initialization` (`let i = 0`) runs once.
        2.  `condition` (`i <= 100`) is checked. If `true`, go to step 3. If `false`, loop ends.
        3.  Loop body (`answer = answer + i;`) is executed.
        4.  `increment/decrement` (`i++`) is executed.
        5.  Go back to step 2.
*   **Equivalence of `i++` and `i = i + 1`:**  `i++` is a more concise way to write `i = i + 1`. They achieve the same result of incrementing `i` by one.

**3.6 Complex Primitives: Arrays and Objects**

*   **Need for Data Aggregation:** In real-world programming, you often need to work with collections of data (lists of names, ages, product details, etc.).  Storing each piece of data in separate variables becomes impractical and unmanageable, especially for large datasets. Arrays and objects are fundamental data structures for organizing and aggregating data.
*   **Arrays:**
    *   **Definition:** Ordered collections of items (elements). Arrays in JavaScript can hold elements of *any data type* (numbers, strings, booleans, objects, even other arrays - though for practical purposes, often arrays are used to store elements of the same type).
    *   **Syntax (Array Literal):**  Use square brackets `[]` to create an array, with elements separated by commas.
        ```javascript
        const peopleNames = ["Herkirath", "Raman", "Priya"]; // Array of strings
        const ages = [21, 23, 25];                       // Array of numbers
        const mixedData = [10, "hello", true, null];    // Array with mixed data types (less common in practice)
        ```
    *   **Indexing:** Array elements are accessed using *zero-based indexing*. The first element is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.
        ```javascript
        console.log(peopleNames[0]); // Output: Herkirath (first element)
        console.log(ages[1]);       // Output: 23 (second element)
        ```
    *   **`.length` Property:** Arrays have a `.length` property that returns the number of elements in the array.
        ```javascript
        console.log(peopleNames.length); // Output: 3
        ```
    *   **Example - Printing Even Numbers in an Array:**
        ```javascript
        const ages = [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 100];

        const numberOfPeople = ages.length; // Get array length and store in a variable

        for (let i = 0; i < numberOfPeople; i++) { // Loop through the array using index 'i'
            if (ages[i] % 2 === 0) {        // Check if the element at index 'i' is even using the modulo operator (%)
                console.log(ages[i]);       // If even, print the element
            }
        }
        // Output: 22, 24, 26, 100
        ```
        *   **Modulo Operator `%`:**  `ages[i] % 2` calculates the *remainder* when `ages[i]` is divided by 2. If the remainder is `0`, it means the number is even.
*   **Objects:**
    *   **Definition:** Unordered collections of *key-value pairs*. Objects are used to represent entities or concepts with properties (attributes). Keys are strings (or Symbols in modern JavaScript), and values can be of any data type.
    *   **Syntax (Object Literal):** Use curly braces `{}` to create an object. Key-value pairs are separated by commas, and within each pair, the key and value are separated by a colon `:`.
        ```javascript
        const person1 = {
            firstName: "Herkirath", // Key: "firstName", Value: "Herkirath"
            gender: "male"         // Key: "gender", Value: "male"
        };

        const product = {
            name: "Laptop",
            price: 1200,
            isAvailable: true
        };
        ```
    *   **Accessing Properties:** Object properties (values) are accessed using either:
        *   **Dot Notation:** `objectName.propertyName` (when the property name is a valid JavaScript identifier - no spaces, special characters, etc.).
        *   **Bracket Notation:** `objectName["propertyName"]` (always works, especially useful when property names have spaces or are determined dynamically).
        ```javascript
        console.log(person1.firstName);     // Output: Herkirath (dot notation)
        console.log(product["price"]);    // Output: 1200 (bracket notation)
        ```
    *   **Arrays of Objects (Common Pattern):** A very common and powerful pattern is to create an array where each element is an object. This is excellent for representing lists of entities, where each entity has multiple attributes.
        ```javascript
        const allUsers = [
            { firstName: "Herkirath", gender: "male" },   // Object 1
            { firstName: "Raman", gender: "male" },      // Object 2
            { firstName: "Priya", gender: "female" }     // Object 3
        ];

        // Example - Printing First Names of Male Users:
        for (let i = 0; i < allUsers.length; i++) {
            if (allUsers[i].gender === "male") { // Access 'gender' property of the i-th object
                console.log(allUsers[i].firstName); // Access 'firstName' property of the i-th object
            }
        }
        // Output: Herkirath, Raman
        ```
        *   **Nested Property Access:** `allUsers[i].gender` demonstrates *nested property access*. First, `allUsers[i]` gets the i-th object from the `allUsers` array. Then, `.gender` accesses the `gender` property of *that* object.  You can chain dot or bracket notation to access properties within nested objects (or arrays).
    *   **Advantages of Objects (vs. separate arrays):**
        *   **Data Grouping:** Objects logically group related pieces of information together (e.g., all attributes of a user are together in a single object).
        *   **Readability and Maintainability:** Arrays of objects are often more readable and easier to maintain than managing multiple parallel arrays (like separate `personNames`, `genders`, `ages` arrays).

**3.7 Functions: Abstraction and Reusability**

*   **Purpose of Functions:**
    *   **Code Reusability:** Functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task. You can then *call* (execute) this function from different parts of your program, avoiding code duplication.
    *   **Abstraction (Black Box):** Functions hide the internal  know its *interface* (what inputs it expects and what output it produces), not *how* it achieves the result internally. This simplifies code and makes it easier to work with.
    *   **Modularity:** Functions break down complex programs into smaller, manageable, and self-contained units, improving code organization and making it easier to develop and debug.
*   **Function Definition Syntax:**
    ```javascript
    function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
        // Function body - code to be executed when the function is called
        // ... function logic ...
        return returnValue; // Optional 'return' statement to send a value back from the function
    }
    ```
    *   **`function` keyword:**  Used to declare a function.
    *   **`functionName`:** The name of the function (following JavaScript identifier rules). Choose descriptive names that indicate what the function does.
    *   **`parameters (parameter1, parameter2, ...)` (Optional):**  Input values that the function accepts. Parameters are listed within parentheses `()`, separated by commas. A function can have zero or more parameters.
    *   **Function Body (`{ ... }`):** The block of code enclosed in curly braces that contains the function's logic. This code is executed when the function is called.
    *   **`return returnValue;` (Optional):** The `return` statement is used to send a value back from the function to the part of the code that called it. A function can return a value or not return anything (in which case it implicitly returns `undefined`).
*   **Example - `findSum` Function:**
    ```javascript
    function findSum(num1, num2) { // Function definition - takes two parameters: num1, num2
        const sumValue = num1 + num2; // Calculate the sum
        return sumValue;             // Return the calculated sum
    }

    // Calling the function:
    const result = findSum(1, 2); // Call 'findSum' with arguments 1 and 2.  The returned value (3) is stored in 'result'
    console.log(result);          // Output: 3

    const anotherResult = findSum(10, 20); // Call 'findSum' again with different arguments
    console.log(anotherResult);     // Output: 30
    ```
    *   **Function Call:** To execute a function, you *call* it by writing its name followed by parentheses `()`. If the function expects arguments (parameters), you provide the *argument values* within the parentheses during the call.
    *   **Return Value:** The `return` statement in `findSum` specifies that the function should *return* the calculated `sumValue`. When `findSum(1, 2)` is called, it calculates the sum (3), and that value `3` is returned and assigned to the `result` variable.
*   **Function Execution Flow:** When a function is called:
    1.  Control (program execution) jumps to the function's definition.
    2.  The code inside the function body is executed, line by line.
    3.  If a `return` statement is encountered, the function execution stops, and the specified value is returned to the caller.
    4.  If there is no `return` statement (or just `return;` without a value), the function implicitly returns `undefined`.
    5.  Control returns to the line of code *after* the function call.

**3.8 Callbacks: Functions as Arguments**

*   **Introduction to Callbacks - Functions as Values:** In JavaScript (and many other languages), functions are *first-class citizens*. This means functions can be treated like any other data type: they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.
*   **Callbacks Explained:** A *callback function* is a function that is passed as an argument to *another function*. The function that receives the callback argument is expected to *call back* (execute) the provided function at some point, often after a certain event has occurred or a task is completed.
*   **Example 1: Function to Choose Display Format (Callbacks for Flexibility):**
    *   Problem: Need a function that calculates the sum and displays the result, but want flexibility in how the result is displayed (e.g., "Result of sum is..." vs. "Sum result is...").
    *   Initial Functions (No Callbacks):
        ```javascript
        function sum(num1, num2) {
            return num1 + num2;
        }

        function displayResult(result) {
            console.log("Result of sum is: " + result); // Display format 1
        }

        function displayResultPassive(result) {
            console.log("Sum result is: " + result);    // Display format 2
        }

        // Using them:
        const answer = sum(1, 2);
        displayResult(answer);       // Calls displayResult (format 1) - Two function calls
        // displayResultPassive(answer); // Calls displayResultPassive (format 2) - Would need to change this line
        ```
    *   Problem with Initial Approach:  To switch between display formats, you have to change the function call (`displayResult` or `displayResultPassive`).  The goal is to make it more dynamic and use *one* function call at the end.
    *   Solution - Using Callbacks:
        ```javascript
        function sum(num1, num2, fnToCall) { // 'fnToCall' is a parameter to receive a callback function
            const result = num1 + num2;
            fnToCall(result);             // Call the callback function (fnToCall) and pass 'result' as an argument
        }

        function displayResult(output) { // Function to display result in format 1 (will be used as a callback)
            console.log("Result of sum is: " + output);
        }

        function displayResultPassive(output) { // Function to display result in format 2 (will be used as a callback)
            console.log("Sum result is: " + output);
        }

        // Calling 'sum' with a callback:
        sum(1, 2, displayResult);        // Pass 'displayResult' function as the 3rd argument.  Format 1 will be used.
        sum(1, 2, displayResultPassive); // Pass 'displayResultPassive' function as the 3rd argument. Format 2 will be used.
        ```
        *   **`fnToCall` Parameter:** The `sum` function now accepts a third parameter, `fnToCall`. This parameter is expected to be a *function*.
        *   **Calling the Callback (`fnToCall(result)`):** Inside `sum`, after calculating the `result`, the line `fnToCall(result);` *calls* the function that was passed in as the `fnToCall` argument.  It passes the `result` as an argument to the callback function.
        *   **Flexibility:** By passing different functions (`displayResult` or `displayResultPassive`) as the third argument to `sum`, you can dynamically control *which display function* gets called and thus change the output format without modifying the `sum` function itself.
    *   **Analogy - Delivery Service:** Think of `sum` as a delivery service. You give it two numbers (the items to process) and tell it *what to do with the result* by giving it a delivery instruction (the callback function).  The delivery service calculates the sum (processes the items) and then follows your delivery instruction (calls the callback function to display the result in the desired format).
*   **Example 2: `setTimeout` - A Built-in Callback Example:**
    *   `setTimeout(callbackFunction, delayInMilliseconds)`: A built-in JavaScript function that is a classic example of using callbacks.
        *   `callbackFunction`:  The function that you want to execute *later*.
        *   `delayInMilliseconds`: The time to wait (in milliseconds) before executing the `callbackFunction`.
    *   Example:
        ```javascript
        function greet() {
            console.log("Hello world");
        }

        setTimeout(greet, 1000); // Call 'greet' function after 1000 milliseconds (1 second)

        function greetAlien() {
            console.log("Hello alien");
        }

        setTimeout(greetAlien, 3000); // Call 'greetAlien' function after 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds)
        ```
        *   **Asynchronous Behavior:** `setTimeout` is an *asynchronous* function. When `setTimeout` is called, it *schedules* the `callbackFunction` to be executed later, but it *doesn't block* the execution of the rest of your code immediately. The JavaScript engine continues to process other tasks while waiting for the timer to expire.
        *   **Event Loop (Implicit):** `setTimeout` relies on the JavaScript *event loop* mechanism to handle asynchronous operations. The event loop is responsible for managing timers, user events, network requests, and callbacks, ensuring that JavaScript remains non-blocking even when dealing with time-delayed or I/O operations (more on the event loop later).
*   **Key Takeaway - Callbacks Enable Asynchronous and Flexible Code:** Callbacks are a fundamental pattern in JavaScript and are crucial for:
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Handling tasks that take time to complete (timers, network requests, file I/O) without blocking the main thread.
    *   **Event Handling:** Responding to user interactions (clicks, key presses) or other events.
    *   **Code Flexibility and Reusability:** Making functions more generic and customizable by allowing users to inject their own logic (callback functions) to be executed at specific points.

**3.9 Bounty Problem Revisited - CPU Usage Mystery**

*   **The Puzzle:**  A JavaScript code snippet with an infinite loop designed to consume CPU was run. The expectation was that one CPU core would go to 100% usage, reflecting JavaScript's single-threaded nature. However, using the `htop` command on macOS, CPU usage didn't show a single core at 100%.
*   **Troubleshooting and Investigation:**
    *   Initial Assumption (Incorrect): JavaScript's single-threaded model was not behaving as expected.
    *   Testing with `top` Command (macOS `top` utility): Switching to the `top` command (another system monitoring utility) *did* show a Node.js process consuming close to 100% CPU.
    *   Google Search and Community Input:  Seeking external information and community feedback.
*   **The Solution - Tooling Issue (Htop Bug):** The conclusion reached (after significant debugging) was that the `htop` command on the specific macOS system was *not accurately reporting CPU usage for Node.js processes* in this particular scenario. The `top` command, a different system monitor, provided a more accurate reading.
*   **Weirdness and Randomness in Programming:**  The speaker emphasizes that programming can sometimes involve encountering unexpected and seemingly illogical issues.  Debugging and problem-solving often require persistence, trying different tools, and questioning assumptions.
*   **Lesson Learned - Tool Verification:**  When debugging, especially performance-related issues, it's important to verify the reliability of your tools. In this case, relying solely on `htop` led to a misleading conclusion. Testing with a different tool (`top`) revealed the actual CPU usage.
*   **Bounty Outcome:**  Due to the unexpected nature of the problem and the tooling issue, no bounty was awarded for finding a "logical" error in the code because there wasn't one in the code's core logic related to single-threading; it was a reporting anomaly.

**3.10 Class Logistics and Next Steps**

*   **Zoom Issues Feedback:**  A poll is conducted to assess the extent of technical issues (audio/video lag, stuttering) experienced by participants during the live class.  A significant portion (around 50%) reported issues, indicating a potential problem with Zoom's performance for this large class size.
*   **Possible Solutions for Zoom Issues:**
    *   **Video Off (Speaker's Video):** Turning off the speaker's video stream to reduce bandwidth usage.
    *   **Alternate Platform (Website Streaming):** Exploring an alternate streaming solution using a website platform, which might offer better scalability or flexibility, even if it introduces a slight delay (15 seconds) but potentially allows for live rewind/playback within the stream itself.
    *   **Dual Links (Zoom and Alternate):** Providing two links for future live classes - a Zoom link and an alternate website streaming link, giving participants a choice.
*   **Pace of the Class:** A poll on the pace of the class indicates a generally "fast" pace for a portion of the audience (15%).  The speaker acknowledges this and suggests potential adjustments:
    *   **Extra Class/TA Support:** Offering extra sessions or TA (Teaching Assistant) support to help those who find the pace challenging to catch up.
    *   **Offline Videos for Basic Concepts:**  Considering shifting more foundational concepts to offline video format, freeing up live class time for more interactive sessions or advanced topics.
*   **Action Items and Next Week's Plan:**
    *   **Offline Video for Asynchronous Programming:**  The remaining topics (asynchronous programming, event loop, promises, callback hell) will be covered in an upcoming offline video, to be released soon (within 2-3 hours, aiming for tomorrow evening).
    *   **Assignments:** Assignments related to the week's topics (JavaScript basics, callbacks) will be released, including instructions on local setup and running tests. A subset of assignments will be posted immediately, with a comprehensive set following with the offline video.
    *   **TA Support:** TAs will be introduced and available on Discord to answer questions and provide help, starting tonight or tomorrow.  Participants are encouraged to direct questions to TAs and peers on Discord.
    *   **Refund Option:**  Reiterating that the refund option is available for those who feel the course pace or format isn't suitable for them.
    *   **Next Week's Focus:**  Next week's live session will likely delve deeper into asynchronous JavaScript, HTTP requests, and potentially DOM manipulation (based on earlier mentions).  An alternate streaming link (website-based) will be provided alongside the Zoom link.
*   **Beginner-Friendly Questions Encouraged:** The speaker encourages participants to ask beginner-friendly questions, emphasizing that no question is too basic, and clarifying fundamental concepts is crucial for everyone's understanding.
*   **Metadata Example Clarification:**  A question about metadata (nested objects) is addressed with a code example to illustrate accessing properties within complex nested JavaScript objects using dot and bracket notation.
*   **Bounty Question Clarification:**  A question about why a specific code snippet related to `setTimeout` was not working is answered, highlighting the common mistake of passing a *value* instead of a *function* as the callback to `setTimeout`. The importance of passing the function *reference* (name) and not calling the function immediately is emphasized.
*   **Void/Undefined Return Value Explanation:**  A question about `undefined` output in a code example is clarified, explaining that functions that don't explicitly `return` a value implicitly return `undefined`.

This detailed breakdown aims to capture every detail, explanation, and nuance from the transcript, providing a comprehensive resource for understanding the concepts covered and the logistical aspects of the class session.
